	  <h4>Amidst the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has outweighed the spread of political propaganda over scientific and accurate information on Twitter. 
</h4><br><br>
	  <p>A tweet analysis on Maduro’s and his Ministry of Health’s Twitter accounts revealed that the Venezuelan regime used the Coronavirus emergency to position its rhetoric on the social platform as the country faced the first stage of the epidemic. 
</p>
    <p>A Python and R analysis were used to assess the regime’s most tweeted words during three key stages of the Covid-19 epidemic in Venezuela: one week before the first confirmed case (6 March), one week after the first confirmed case (13 March), and one week after the first confirmed death (25 March), which also was the date that marked the record of 100 contagions. 
</p>
    <p>These stages coincide with the anticipation, early detection, and containment phases, respectively, described by the World Health Organization (WHO) in its guidance to control epidemics. 
</p>
    <p>During the anticipation phase, the Venezuelan ruler barely tweeted once about the coronavirus. The following week, that number amounted to 21 tweets, and then dropped back to 17 after the first death was recorded.

    <p>Contrary to the presidential account, most of the tweets published by the Ministry of Health during that period bear some relation, either directly or indirectly, to the novel coronavirus. In some cases, the publications did not identify the virus by name, but did mention terms such as "pneumonia" or "respiratory diseases," as well as promoting handwashing in some cases.

    <p>“This has been a complete disaster from the communicational point of view,” said Jose Felix Oletta, former Venezuelan minister of health. “The government is using monologues impregnated with high political content that has nothing to do with public health issues.”

    <h4><b>Words on pandemic and propaganda</b></h4>
	  <p>The most used term by the Ministry of Health account is Nicolas Maduro’s username. This is followed by words like “prevention”, “virus”, and “covid”, as well as other terms that refer to the global campaign to stop the proliferation of cases through handwashing and avoiding touching your eyes or nose with dirty hands.</p>
	  <p>However, to Oletta the campaign promoted by the Ministry of Health is highly contradictory, as the lack of public services, including water, makes it impossible for the population to comply with preventive measures.
</p>
	  <p>Unlike the account of the Ministry of Health, Nicolás Maduro mentioned very little the terminology associated with Covid-19 during the first week of March, that is, in the period corresponding to the prevention phase.
</p>
	  <p>This shows the lack of coordination between the message that the Ministry of Health was trying to send at the beginning of the epidemic in Venezuela and that of the head of state. 
</p>
    <p>Maduro’s most frequent terms during the first stage of the epidemic refer to the rhetoric of Chavismo, a nationalist narrative promoted by later president Hugo Chavez during his mandate. 
</p>
    <p>The week before the detection of the first case, the words "Covid-19" or "Coronavirus" did not even appear among the 15 most frequent terms. On the contrary, terms associated with Chavista propaganda do appear, such as "homeland", "people", "Chávez" and "Bolivarian", often exalted in the official discourse. 
</p>
	<p>After the detection of the first Covid-19 case, terms related to the pandemic appeared in Maduro’s Twitter timeline, but without neglecting government rhetoric.

	  <p>In the containment stage, terms that refer to state control -and that have no direct relationship to the pandemic or the terminology used by the WHO- appeared, such as "peace", "stability", "union" and "moral", reinforcing government’s one-sided discourse.

	  <p>“They (the government) always appeal to terms like “peace” and “union” when they find themselves in trouble. They always used them in complex contests, such as in the middle of social unrest”, explained data science specialist and doctor Julio Castro.
</p>
	  <p>To former minister Oletta, these terms project an authoritarian behavior disguising behind the pandemic. “The emergency derived from Covid-19 is being used as a political tool. The end of the government’s message is not necessarily related to public health, but political control.

    <p>In March, Twitter punished the Venezuelan regime by restricting the accounts of several officials and institutions after sharing the recipe of a natural remedy arguing that it could prevent contagion. 
</p> 
    <p>The Ministry of Health was one of the accounts that shared this content and, after being temporarily restricted, the social platform finally suspended the user. This action obeys Twitter’s recently adopted strategy to prevent the spread of misinformation during the pandemic.  
</p> 
    <p>The social platform announced that among the violation of the new regulations was "the description of alleged cures for Covid-19", which despite not being Immediately harmful, they are ineffective and shared for a misleading purpose.
</p> 
    <p>But not only the Ministry of Health has violated Twitter's policies. Maduro also did it when the social network temporarily restricted his account and removed a tweet in which he recommended the naturopathic recipe against Covid-19.
</p> 
    <p>Through official accounts, the Venezuelan government has used the pandemic to position its narrative, promote state control, and spread misleading content in a country where the majority of the population has turned to Twitter to search for verified information amid censorship. imposed by the state.
</p> 
    <p>“There’s a communicational hegemony. The government is not listening to specialists nor academics as it is promoting empirical remedies that are worthless. What people need the most is effective communication, especially in a country with a fragile health system,” Oletta said.
